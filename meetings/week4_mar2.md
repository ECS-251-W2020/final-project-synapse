### TODO for this week

1. Finish up the core functionality work and instrumenter integration.

2. Test on benchmarks.

### Blockers

1. Had an issue with getting actual class / API names in code from TSC - working on this.

2. HB Inference a bit complicated to implement - currently working on a version without HB Inference, and DynamicRandom.
