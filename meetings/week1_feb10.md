# Scrum - Week 1: Feb 10th - 16th

**Trello**: [Link](https://trello.com/b/UcUVXC8C/ecs251-synapse)

### What did we do last week?

1. Decided on topic + finished proposal

2. Wrote starter code for simulating TSV (experimenting with thread-unsafe functions)

3. Starting looking up Java documentation for thread-unsafe methods and classes.

4. Exploring the C\# TSVD implementation for checking how TSCs were implemented in instrumenter.

### TODO for this week

1. Finish understanding Java multithreading model + instrumentation API. Should be able to work with multithreaded Java code.

2. Manually shorlist at least 5-6 classes, examine their thread-unsafe methods + start writing TSC

3. Finalise benchmarks; contact EPCC for Java Grande Suite

### Blockers

None for now - we're still getting up to speed with implementing the TSC and figuring out instrumentation, and also understanding the multithreading model (Alfred), so blockers if any would crop up after this week.
